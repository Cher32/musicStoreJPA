     "Two years after releasing his classic, heralded debut, Illmatic, Nas came 
    back with It Was Written, a great piece of work that is underappreciated by
    most because Nas set the bar so ridiculously high with his first record. 
    People looked at the liner notes and saw that neither Pete Rock nor Large 
    Professor produced any tracks on Nas' sophomore effort, and they then 
    dubbed it a bust without even listening to it."
