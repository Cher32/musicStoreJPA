        "On Miseducation, Lauryn Hill demonstrates that she was one of the coldest 
        MCs of her era. It has always been the case, however, that a woman could 
        rhyme ridiculous and still never be considered the best of them all. In a way, 
        it didn't matter. Even if she wanted to, Ms. Hill could not have spent a 
        career talking about crooked cops, gold chains and project come-ups. Being a 
        woman meant that she had to, for a time at least, talk about the truth of 
        her self. When your body is the very weapon of your oppression, it sometimes 
        must be through the art of self, soul, and spirit that you create your freedom."
